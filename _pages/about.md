   I am a postdoc with the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University, Denmark. I received my Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees from Northeastern University in 2017, 2019, and 2024, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. [Ge Yu](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yuge/en/index.html). From 2022 to 2024, I was a guest Ph.D. at Aalborg University, hosted by Assistant Prof. [Tianyi Li](http://tianyili.site/).  I have published several papers in top conferences and journals, including VLDB, TKDE, etc.
